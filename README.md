## Setup

Clone the client (this) and the server (link above) projects.

Open both projects in Unity3D, version 2020.1 was used for this tutorial.


### Server

Open the server project, and hit run. You may be prompted to allow the server through the firewall.

### Client

Open the client project, and hit run. Enter a name when prompted and hit connect. You will auto join the server if it's up and running and be able to move. 

You should be able to see yourself and any other clients that join moving around in both the client and server editor windows.
